<p> Samsung Galaxy (stylized as SAMSUNG Galaxy, previously Samsung GALAXY) is a series of mobile computing devices designed, manufactured and marketed by Samsung Electronics. 

The product line includes the Galaxy S series of high-end smartphones, the Galaxy Tab series of tablets, the Galaxy Note series of tablets and phablets with the added functionality of a stylus and the first version of the Galaxy Gear smartwatch, with later versions dropping the Galaxy branding.

Samsung Galaxy devices have traditionally used the Android operating system produced by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google, usually with a custom user interface called TouchWiz. 
This tradition was broken at CES 2016 with the announcement of the first Galaxy-branded Windows 10 device, the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. </p>
